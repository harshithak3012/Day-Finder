This C code is a simple program to determine the day of the week for a given date. It takes input from the user in the format of day, month, and year (DD MM YYYY), then calculates the day of the week using Zeller's Congruence algorithm. Finally, it prints out the day of the week corresponding to the input date.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

dayofweek function:

Parameters: int d for day, int m for month, and int y for year.
It uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to calculate the day of the week.
The algorithm is a mathematical formula to determine the day of the week for any date.
It calculates the day of the week as an integer value (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).
Returns the integer representing the day of the week.
main function:

Declares variables day, month, and year to store user input.
Initializes an array of strings days[] containing the names of the days of the week.
Prompts the user to enter the date in the specified format.
Reads the input date using scanf.
Calls the dayofweek function to calculate the day of the week for the input date.
Prints the day of the week corresponding to the input date.
const char *days[]:

An array of strings containing the names of the days of the week.
Each element corresponds to a day of the week, starting from Sunday at index 0.
Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a day of the week calculator using Zeller's Congruence algorithm in C.
